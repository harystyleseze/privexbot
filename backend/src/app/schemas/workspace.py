Pydantic schemas for Workspace API requests and responses.

WHY:
- Validate workspace operations within organizations
- Handle workspace-level permissions
- Support fine-grained access control

# Workspace Roles

    PERMISSION: Workspace admin or org admin/owner
    \"\"\"

    id: UUID4
    name: str
    chatbot_count: int
    user_role: WorkspaceRole | None
        WHY: Show current user's role in this workspace

PERMISSION FLOW:
----------------
When user accesses workspace:
1. Check user is org member (from org_id in JWT)
2. Check user is workspace member OR org admin/owner
3. If workspace member, check role for specific permission
4. If org admin/owner, grant admin-level access

USAGE:
------
POST /api/v1/workspaces
{
    "name": "Engineering Team",
    "organization_id": "uuid"
}
-> Creates workspace in org

POST /api/v1/workspaces/{ws_id}/members
{
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "role": "editor"
}
-> Add user to workspace as editor

# Workspace Roles Type

# WHY: Type-safe workspace roles with IDE autocomplete
# ADMIN: Full workspace control (manage members, create/edit/delete chatbots)
# EDITOR: Can create/edit chatbots, cannot delete or manage members
# VIEWER: Read-only access, can view chatbots and configurations
