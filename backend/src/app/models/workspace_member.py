"""
WorkspaceMember model - User membership in workspace with role.

WHY:
- Fine-grained access control within workspaces
- Not all org members need access to all workspaces
- Separate permissions for different teams/projects

HOW:
- Junction table between User and Workspace
- User must be org member to be workspace member
- Role determines what user can do in this workspace

PSEUDOCODE:
-----------
class WorkspaceMember(Base):
    __tablename__ = "workspace_members"

    # Fields
    id: UUID (primary key, auto-generated)

    user_id: UUID (foreign key -> users.id, indexed, cascade delete)
        WHY: Which user has access to this workspace
        HOW: When user deleted, their workspace access is removed

    workspace_id: UUID (foreign key -> workspaces.id, indexed, cascade delete)
        WHY: Which workspace this membership grants access to
        HOW: When workspace deleted, all memberships deleted

    role: str (enum: 'admin', 'editor', 'viewer', required)
        WHY: Determines user's permissions in this workspace
        HOW: Used to control chatbot create/edit/delete operations

        ROLES EXPLAINED:
        - 'admin': Full workspace control
            * Create/edit/delete chatbots
            * Manage workspace members
            * Edit workspace settings
            * View all workspace data

        - 'editor': Content management
            * Create/edit chatbots
            * Cannot delete chatbots
            * Cannot manage members
            * View workspace data

        - 'viewer': Read-only access
            * View chatbots and configurations
            * Cannot create or edit
            * Cannot manage members
            * Good for stakeholders/observers

    created_at: datetime (auto-set on creation)
    updated_at: datetime (auto-update on modification)

    # Constraints
    unique_constraint: (user_id, workspace_id)
        WHY: User can only have one role per workspace
        HOW: Prevents conflicting permissions

    # Relationships
    user: User (many-to-one back reference)
        WHY: Access user details

    workspace: Workspace (many-to-one back reference)
        WHY: Access workspace and parent org details

PERMISSION HIERARCHY:
---------------------
WHY: Org admins/owners should access all workspaces
HOW: Check permissions in this order:
    1. If user is org 'owner' or 'admin' -> grant admin access to workspace
    2. Else check WorkspaceMember role for this workspace
    3. If no WorkspaceMember entry -> no access

EXAMPLE ACCESS CONTROL:
-----------------------
Scenario: User wants to delete chatbot in Workspace X

Check 1: Is user active?
Check 2: Get user's org role from OrganizationMember
    - If 'owner' or 'admin' -> ALLOW (org admins can do anything)

Check 3: Get user's workspace role from WorkspaceMember
    - If 'admin' -> ALLOW
    - If 'editor' or 'viewer' -> DENY
    - If no entry -> DENY

VALIDATION RULES:
-----------------
WHY: User must be org member before becoming workspace member
HOW: Before creating WorkspaceMember:
    1. Get workspace.organization_id
    2. Verify OrganizationMember exists for (user_id, organization_id)
    3. If not -> reject with error "Must be organization member first"
