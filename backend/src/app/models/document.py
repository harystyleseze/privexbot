"""
Document model - Individual documents within a knowledge base.

WHY:
- Store source documents for RAG system
- Track processing status and metadata
- Support multiple source types (files, text, web)
- Enable document-level operations (archive, disable, delete)

HOW:
- Belongs to a knowledge base
- Parsed into chunks for embedding
- Status tracking for async processing
- Rich metadata for filtering

PSEUDOCODE:
-----------
class Document(Base):
    __tablename__ = "documents"

    # Identity
    id: UUID (primary key, auto-generated)
        WHY: Unique identifier for this document

    knowledge_base_id: UUID (foreign key -> knowledge_bases.id, indexed, cascade delete)
        WHY: Links to parent knowledge base
        HOW: When KB deleted, all documents deleted

    name: str (required, max_length=255)
        WHY: Document filename or title
        EXAMPLE: "Product_Manual_v2.pdf", "FAQ Document"

    # Source Information
    source_type: str (enum)
        WHY: Track where document came from
        VALUES: "file_upload", "text_input", "website", "google_docs", "notion", "confluence", "api"
        HOW: Different sources may require different parsing

    source_url: str | None (max_length=2048)

        }

        USE CASE: Filter queries by metadata
        query = "How to deploy?" + filter(department="Engineering")

    # Chunking Configuration (Document-Level Override)
    chunking_config: JSONB | None
        WHY: Allow per-document chunking strategy
        HOW: Overrides KB default if specified

        WHY: Provide context to help AI better understand and use this document
        HOW: User-defined annotations guide retrieval and response generation

        STRUCTURE:
        {
            "enabled": false,
                WHY: Toggle annotations on/off

            "category": "document" | "workspace" | "policy" | "guide" | "faq" | "api_docs",
                WHY: Document type classification
                HOW: Helps AI understand document purpose

            "importance": "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical",
                WHY: Priority level for retrieval
                HOW: Higher importance = higher relevance boost

            "purpose": str,
                WHY: Explain why this document exists

        }

    # Lifecycle Management
    is_enabled: bool (default: True)
        WHY: Soft disable without deleting
        HOW: Disabled docs not included in search
        USE: Temporary removal or testing

    is_archived: bool (default: False)
        WHY: Keep historical docs without active use
        HOW: Archived docs cannot be edited unless unarchived

    disabled_at: datetime | None
    archived_at: datetime | None
    auto_disabled_reason: str | None
        WHY: Track why document was auto-disabled
        EXAMPLE: "Disabled after 20 days of inactivity"

    # Timestamps
    created_by: UUID (foreign key -> users.id)
    created_at: datetime (auto-set)
    updated_at: datetime (auto-update)
    last_accessed_at: datetime | None
        WHY: Track usage for auto-disable feature

    # Relationships
    knowledge_base: KnowledgeBase (many-to-one)
        WHY: Access parent KB and workspace

    chunks: list[Chunk] (one-to-many, cascade delete)
        WHY: All chunks from this document
        HOW: When document deleted, chunks deleted

    creator: User (many-to-one)

    # Indexes
    index: (knowledge_base_id, status)
        WHY: Fast queries for KB documents by status

    index: (knowledge_base_id, is_enabled, is_archived)
        WHY: Filter active documents

    index: (source_type)
        WHY: Group by source type

    index: (file_hash)
        WHY: Detect duplicate uploads (if file_hash in source_metadata)

DOCUMENT LIFECYCLE:
-------------------
1. Upload/Create:
    status = "pending"
    is_enabled = True

2. Processing Pipeline:
    status = "processing" → parse content → extract text
    status = "embedding" → create chunks → generate embeddings
    status = "completed" → ready for use

3. Usage:
    last_accessed_at updated on each query
    Track usage statistics

4. Maintenance:
    Auto-disable after 20 days:
        if last_accessed_at < now() - 20 days:
            status = "disabled"
            auto_disabled_reason = "Inactive for 20 days"

5. Archival:
    User archives:
        is_archived = True
        archived_at = now()
        Cannot be edited unless unarchived

6. Deletion:
    Permanent removal:
        Delete document → cascade delete chunks → remove embeddings from vector store

PROCESSING STATES:
------------------
pending → processing → embedding → completed
                   ↓
                failed (with error_message)

METADATA FILTERING:
-------------------
WHY: Enable powerful search capabilities
HOW: Store custom metadata, index in vector store

EXAMPLE QUERY:
    query = "deployment steps"
    filters = {
        "custom_metadata": {
            "department": "Engineering",
            "version": "2.0"
        },
        "source_type": "google_docs",
        "is_enabled": True
    }

    → Returns only chunks from Engineering docs, version 2.0

BATCH OPERATIONS:
-----------------
WHY: Manage many documents efficiently
HOW: Support bulk enable/disable/archive/delete

EXAMPLE:
    # Disable all documents from specific source
    Document.query.filter(
        source_type == "website",
        source_url.startswith("https://old-site.com")
    ).update(is_enabled=False)

RE-PROCESSING:
--------------
WHY: Update when chunking strategy changes
HOW: Track need for re-processing

TRIGGER:
    - Chunking config changes at KB level
    - User changes document-specific chunking
    - Vector store migration

PROCESS:
    1. Mark document: status = "processing"
    2. Delete existing chunks
    3. Re-parse and re-chunk
    4. Generate new embeddings
    5. Update vector store
    6. status = "completed"

AUTO-SYNC (For Cloud Sources):
-------------------------------
WHY: Keep documents up-to-date from source
HOW: Background job checks for updates

EXAMPLE (Google Docs):
    Every 24 hours:
        1. Check document modified date from Google API
        2. If modified > last_synced_at:
            - Re-fetch content
            - Re-process
            - Update last_synced_at

SECURITY:
---------
WHY: Files may contain sensitive data
HOW: Tenant isolation + access control

- file_path includes workspace_id for isolation
- Cannot access documents from other workspaces
- File storage encrypted at rest
- API access requires valid API key with KB permissions
