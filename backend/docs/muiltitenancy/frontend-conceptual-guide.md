## 1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture Concepts

### 1.1 The Hierarchy Model

**WHY this structure?**
Multi-tenancy requires clear boundaries and inheritance patterns. The three-tier hierarchy provides logical separation while maintaining flexibility:

```
User (Identity)
â””â”€â”€ Organization (Billing & Top-level Control)
    â””â”€â”€ Workspace (Resource Container)
        â””â”€â”€ Resources (Chatbots, Flows, Knowledge Bases)
```

**WHAT each level represents:**
- **User**: An individual person with authentication credentials
- **Organization**: A billing entity (company, team, or individual account)
- **Workspace**: A project environment within an organization
- **Resources**: The actual work artifacts (bots, flows, data)

**HOW this enables multi-tenancy:**
- Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles
- Organizations provide complete data isolation
- Workspaces allow project separation within the same billing entity
- Resources inherit permissions from their workspace and organization

### 1.2 Context Switching Philosophy

**WHY context switching is essential:**
Users need to mentally and functionally "be in" a specific organizational and workspace context to:
- See only relevant data and resources
- Have appropriate permissions for their current role
- Avoid accidental cross-contamination between projects
- Maintain clear mental models of what they're working on

**WHAT context means:**
Context is the combination of:
- Which organization the user is currently "in"
- Which workspace within that organization they're focused on
- What permissions they have in this specific context
- What resources they can see and modify

**HOW context affects the entire application:**
- Every API call is filtered by current organization and workspace
- Navigation menus show only permitted sections
- Create buttons appear only if user can create in current context
- Data displays are scoped to current workspace
- Error messages reference current context for clarity

### 1.3 Inheritance & Permission Models

**WHY hierarchical permissions:**
- **Simplicity**: Users understand "if I'm an org admin, I can do admin things everywhere in the org"
- **Security**: Default-deny with explicit grants moving down the hierarchy
- **Scalability**: Adding new workspaces doesn't require reconfiguring user permissions

**WHAT the inheritance looks like:**
```
Organization Owner
â”œâ”€â”€ Can do EVERYTHING in organization
â”œâ”€â”€ Can create/delete workspaces
â”œâ”€â”€ Can manage all organization members
â””â”€â”€ Automatically has admin access to all workspaces

Organization Admin
â”œâ”€â”€ Can manage organization settings
â”œâ”€â”€ Can create workspaces
â”œâ”€â”€ Can invite members to organization
â””â”€â”€ Has admin access to all workspaces

Organization Member
â”œâ”€â”€ Can see organization exists
â”œâ”€â”€ Needs explicit workspace invitation
â””â”€â”€ Has only granted workspace permissions

Workspace Admin
â”œâ”€â”€ Can manage workspace settings
â”œâ”€â”€ Can invite workspace members
â””â”€â”€ Can create/edit/delete workspace resources

Workspace Editor
â”œâ”€â”€ Can create and modify resources
â””â”€â”€ Cannot manage workspace membership

Workspace Viewer
â””â”€â”€ Can only read resources
```

## 2. Authentication & Context Flow

### 2.1 The JWT Token as Context Container

**WHY JWT tokens for context:**
- **Stateless**: Server doesn't need to store user sessions
- **Secure**: Cryptographically signed, tamper-evident
- **Informative**: Contains all context information needed for each request
- **Efficient**: No database lookup needed to determine user permissions

**WHAT the token contains:**
```
JWT Payload:
{
  user_id: "who the user is",
  organization_id: "which org they're currently in",
  workspace_id: "which workspace they're focused on",
  permissions: {
    "specific_action": true/false for each possible action
  },
  expiration: "when this context expires"
}
```

**HOW context switching works:**
1. User clicks "switch to different organization"
2. Frontend sends switch request to backend
3. Backend verifies user has access to target organization
4. Backend generates NEW JWT with new organization/workspace context
5. Backend returns new token with updated permissions
6. Frontend stores new token and refreshes all data
7. User now sees completely different set of resources

### 2.2 Context Persistence Strategy

**WHY context needs to persist:**
Users expect to return to the same organizational context when they come back to the application. Losing context creates confusion and inefficiency.

**WHAT gets persisted:**
- Current organization selection
- Current workspace selection within that organization
- Authentication token (with expiration handling)

**HOW persistence works:**
- JWT token stored in secure browser storage
- Token contains current context information
- On app reload, token is validated and context restored
- If token expired, user logs in and returns to default context

### 2.3 Context Boundaries

**WHY clear boundaries matter:**
Users need to understand what changes when they switch context and what stays the same.

**WHAT changes with context:**
- All resource lists (bots, flows, knowledge bases)
- All metrics and analytics
- Available actions (create, edit, delete)
- Navigation menu items (based on permissions)
- Search results

**WHAT stays constant:**
- User profile and preferences
- Overall application layout and navigation patterns
- Available organizations (user can always see which orgs they belong to)

## 3. User Interface Design Philosophy

### 3.1 Slack-Inspired Workspace Model

**WHY the Slack model works:**
- **Familiar**: Most users understand Slack's workspace switching
- **Visual**: Clear visual indication of current context
- **Efficient**: Quick switching without losing mental context
- **Scalable**: Works for users with 1 organization or 50 organizations

**WHAT makes this pattern effective:**
- Persistent sidebar shows current organization prominently
- Workspace icons provide visual recognition (like Slack channels)
- Active workspace highlighted with distinct visual treatment
- One-click switching between workspaces within same organization

**HOW to maintain user orientation:**
- Always show current organization name at top of sidebar
- Highlight active workspace with contrasting background color
- Show workspace initials/icons for quick visual identification
- Display user's role in current context subtly but clearly

### 3.2 Progressive Disclosure

**WHY progressive disclosure matters:**
Users shouldn't be overwhelmed with all possible actions if they can't perform them in their current context and role.

**WHAT gets disclosed progressively:**
- Menu items appear only if user has relevant permissions
- Create buttons show only if user can create in current workspace
- Admin sections visible only to administrators
- Billing information only for organization owners/admins

**HOW this improves usability:**
- Cleaner interface with less visual clutter
- Users don't attempt actions they can't complete
- Clear indication of user's current capabilities
- Reduces support requests about "missing" features

### 3.3 Context Feedback Systems

**WHY users need context feedback:**
Users must always know where they are in the multi-tenant hierarchy and what they can do.

**WHAT feedback to provide:**
- Current organization and workspace clearly displayed
- User's role in current context
- Breadcrumb-like navigation showing hierarchy
- Visual indicators for active selections

**HOW to make context clear:**
- Organization name always visible in sidebar header
- Active workspace highlighted with brand colors
- User avatar with role indicator
- Page titles include workspace context when relevant

## 4. Data Flow & State Management

### 4.1 Workspace-Scoped Data Loading

**WHY workspace scoping is critical:**
Users should never accidentally see data from other workspaces or organizations. This prevents confusion and maintains security boundaries.

**WHAT gets scoped by workspace:**
- All chatbots and chatflows
- Analytics and metrics
- Activity feeds and logs
- Team member lists (workspace members)
- Settings and configuration

**HOW scoping affects data loading:**
```
User switches workspace:
1. Frontend detects workspace change
2. Current workspace ID updated in application state
3. All data queries automatically include workspace filter
4. Previous workspace data cleared from memory
5. New workspace data loaded and displayed
6. User sees completely fresh view of new workspace
```

### 4.2 Optimistic Updates vs. Server Truth

**WHY balance optimism with verification:**
Users expect immediate feedback for their actions, but multi-tenant systems require server-side permission verification.

**WHAT gets optimistic updates:**
- UI state changes (expanding menus, highlighting selections)
- Local form validation feedback
- Non-critical preference updates

**WHAT requires server verification:**
- Resource creation (chatbots, workspaces)
- Permission-sensitive actions (deleting, sharing)
- Context switching (organization/workspace changes)
- Member management (invitations, role changes)

**HOW to balance responsiveness with accuracy:**
- Show immediate UI feedback for user actions
- Display loading states for server-dependent operations
- Gracefully handle server rejections with clear error messages
- Revert optimistic changes if server disagrees

### 4.3 Cache Invalidation Strategy

**WHY cache invalidation is complex in multi-tenant:**
Data cached for one workspace context should not accidentally appear when user switches to different workspace.

**WHAT needs cache invalidation:**
- Resource lists when switching workspaces
- User permissions when role changes
- Organization member lists when switching organizations
- Analytics data when time period or workspace changes

**HOW to handle cache invalidation:**
- Tag cached data with workspace/organization identifiers
- Clear workspace-specific cache on context switch
- Implement cache keys that include current context
- Use server timestamps to detect stale data

## 5. Security & Permission Models

### 5.1 Defense in Depth

**WHY multiple security layers:**
Multi-tenant applications have complex attack surfaces. A single security failure could expose data across organizational boundaries.

**WHAT security layers exist:**
1. **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
2. **Authorization**: Checking what user can do
3. **Context Validation**: Ensuring user is in correct organizational context
4. **Resource Filtering**: Only showing user's accessible resources
5. **Action Validation**: Server-side verification of all user actions

**HOW layers work together:**
- Frontend checks permissions before showing UI elements
- Backend verifies permissions before processing requests
- Database queries include tenant filters
- API responses filtered by user's current context
- Audit logs track all cross-tenant access attempts

### 5.2 Permission-Based UI Rendering

**WHY hide unauthorized features:**
Showing features users can't use creates frustration and confusion. It's better to hide capabilities they don't have.

**WHAT gets permission-based treatment:**
- Navigation menu items
- Action buttons (create, edit, delete)
- Settings sections
- Administrative features
- Billing and subscription information

**HOW permission checking works:**
```
For each UI element:
1. Check user's permissions in current context
2. If user has required permission â†’ show element
3. If user lacks permission â†’ hide element completely
4. If permission uncertain â†’ show with disabled state

Example:
- Create Bot button only appears if user has "chatbot:create" permission
- Organization Settings only visible to org admins/owners
- Workspace member management only for workspace admins
```

### 5.3 Token Refresh and Session Management

**WHY token refresh is critical:**
JWT tokens should have reasonable expiration times for security, but users shouldn't be frequently logged out during active work sessions.

**WHAT happens during token refresh:**
- Old token approaches expiration
- Background refresh request sent to server
- Server validates current user state and permissions
- New token issued with extended expiration
- User continues working without interruption

**HOW refresh maintains security:**
- Server checks user account status during refresh
- Disabled accounts cannot get token refresh
- Permission changes reflected in new token
- Revoked access results in failed refresh and logout

## 6. User Experience Patterns

### 6.1 Onboarding New Users

**WHY onboarding is complex in multi-tenant:**
New users need to understand not just the application features, but also the organizational structure and their role within it.

**WHAT new users need to understand:**
- Which organization they belong to
- What their role allows them to do
- How to switch between workspaces
- Where to find relevant resources for their work

**HOW to guide new users:**
- Start with clear context: "You're now in [Organization] as a [Role]"
- Highlight current workspace and explain workspace concept
- Show permission-appropriate tour of available features
- Provide contextual help for multi-tenancy concepts

### 6.2 Workspace Discovery and Navigation

**WHY workspace discovery matters:**
Users in large organizations may belong to many workspaces but only actively work in a few. They need efficient ways to find and switch to relevant workspaces.

**WHAT helps with workspace discovery:**
- Recent workspace list (most recently accessed)
- Workspace search functionality
- Visual workspace identifiers (icons, colors)
- Workspace descriptions and member counts

**HOW to optimize workspace navigation:**
- Keep frequently used workspaces easily accessible
- Show workspace activity indicators (recent changes)
- Allow users to "favorite" or pin important workspaces
- Provide workspace search across all user's accessible workspaces

### 6.3 Error Handling in Multi-Tenant Context

**WHY errors need context awareness:**
Generic error messages are confusing in multi-tenant applications. Users need to understand which organizational context the error relates to.

**WHAT makes errors contextual:**
- Include current organization and workspace in error messages
- Explain permission-related errors in terms of user's current role
- Suggest appropriate actions based on user's available permissions
- Provide escalation paths (contact workspace admin, etc.)

**HOW to craft helpful error messages:**
```
Instead of: "Access denied"
Better: "You don't have permission to create chatbots in the 'Marketing' workspace. Contact your workspace admin to request editor access."

Instead of: "Resource not found"
Better: "This chatbot doesn't exist in your current workspace 'Development'. It may be in a different workspace or organization."
```

## 7. Technical Decision Rationale

### 7.1 React Context vs. State Management Libraries

**WHY React Context for tenant state:**
- **Simplicity**: Multi-tenancy context is relatively simple (org ID, workspace ID, permissions)
- **Native**: No additional dependencies or learning curve
- **Performance**: Context changes are infrequent (only when switching organizations/workspaces)
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing React patterns

**WHAT Context manages:**
- Current organization information
- Current workspace information
- User permissions in current context
- Context switching functions

**HOW Context differs from global state:**
- Context is specifically for tenant-related information
- Other application state (UI preferences, form data) managed separately
- Context changes trigger complete data refresh
- Context is always driven by server-side JWT token

### 7.2 JWT vs. Session-Based Authentication

**WHY JWT for multi-tenant applications:**
- **Stateless**: Server doesn't need to maintain session storage for each user/org/workspace combination
- **Scalable**: No session synchronization across multiple server instances
- **Informative**: Token contains all context information needed for each request
- **Secure**: Cryptographically signed and tamper-evident

**WHAT JWT enables:**
- Single token contains user identity and current context
- Server can validate permissions without database lookup
- Easy context switching by issuing new tokens
- Natural expiration and refresh patterns

**HOW JWT simplifies multi-tenancy:**
- Each context switch results in new JWT with updated permissions
- No server-side session state to manage across tenant boundaries
- Clear audit trail of user actions in specific organizational contexts

### 7.3 Permission Storage Strategy

**WHY store permissions in JWT:**
- **Performance**: No database lookup required for permission checks
- **Consistency**: Permissions match exactly what server verified when issuing token
- **Offline**: Frontend can make UI decisions without server round-trips
- **Simplicity**: Single source of truth for user's current capabilities

**WHAT permissions look like:**
```
permissions: {
  "org:read": true,
  "org:write": false,
  "workspace:create": true,
  "chatbot:create": true,
  "chatbot:edit": true,
  "chatbot:delete": false
}
```

**HOW permissions drive UI:**
- Each UI element checks specific permission before rendering
- Granular permissions allow fine-tuned access control
- Permission changes require new JWT (via context switch or refresh)
- Clear permission naming convention makes code readable

### 7.4 Data Loading Patterns

**WHY workspace-scoped loading:**
- **Security**: Prevents accidental cross-workspace data exposure
- **Performance**: Smaller data sets load faster
- **Clarity**: Users see only relevant information
- **Consistency**: Matches user's mental model of workspace boundaries

**WHAT gets workspace filtering:**
- All resource lists (chatbots, flows, knowledge bases)
- Analytics and metrics
- Activity feeds
- Search results
- User lists (workspace members)

**HOW workspace scoping works:**
```
Data loading pattern:
1. User action triggers data request
2. Current workspace ID automatically added to request
3. Server filters all results by workspace
4. Frontend receives only workspace-relevant data
5. No additional filtering needed in frontend
```
