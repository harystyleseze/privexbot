Yes! Absolutely! Using PgAdmin UI is perfect for SecretVM. Here's how:

ðŸ”§ Change PostgreSQL Password via PgAdmin UI

Step 1: Access PgAdmin

Open your browser and go to:
https://pgadmin.sapphire-finch.vm.scrtlabs.com

Step 2: Login to PgAdmin

Email: privexbot@gmail.comPassword: (from your .env PGADMIN_PASSWORD)

Step 3: Connect to PostgreSQL Server

1. In the left sidebar, click "Add New Server" (or right-click "Servers" â†’ "Register" â†’ "Server")
2. General Tab:

   - Name: PrivexBot Production

3. Connection Tab:

   - Host name/address: postgres (the container name)
   - Port: 5432
   - Maintenance database: privexbot
   - Username: privexbot
   - Password: Leave blank for now (we'll try common passwords)
   - Save password: Check this box

4. Click "Save"

If connection fails, try these passwords one by one:

- (empty - just press connect)
- privexbot
- postgres

Step 4: Change the Password

Once connected:

1. Click on your server in the left sidebar to expand it
2. Right-click on "Login/Group Roles" â†’ "Query Tool"
3. In the query window, paste this SQL:

ALTER USER privexbot WITH PASSWORD

4. Click the â–¶ Execute button (or press F5)
5. You should see: "ALTER ROLE" in the output (means success!)

Step 5: Restart Backend Container

Since SecretVM doesn't allow command line, use the SecretVM Portal:

1. Go to SecretVM portal
2. Navigate to your VM services
3. Find privexbot-backend-secretvm
4. Click "Restart" button

Step 6: Watch the Logs

In the SecretVM portal, view logs for privexbot-backend-secretvm:

Expected output:
âœ… Database connection successful
âœ… Database migrations completed successfully
ðŸš€ Starting production server with gunicorn...
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000

---

ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: SQL Query to Find Current Password Issue

If you can't connect to PostgreSQL at all, try this:

In PgAdmin Query Tool (after connecting as postgres superuser):

-- Check if the privexbot user exists
SELECT usename, usesysid FROM pg_user WHERE usename = 'privexbot';

-- Check database owner
SELECT datname, datdba FROM pg_database WHERE datname = 'privexbot';

-- Reset password (run this after connecting)
ALTER USER privexbot WITH PASSWORD

-- Verify it worked
\du privexbot

---

ðŸ“‹ Troubleshooting PgAdmin Connection

Can't Connect to PgAdmin at All?

Check that PgAdmin container is running in SecretVM portal. If not:

- Restart the entire docker-compose stack via portal
- Or restart just the privexbot-pgadmin-secretvm service

PgAdmin Login Fails?

The default credentials from your .env.secretvm.local are:

- Email: privexbot@gmail.com
- Password:

If different, check your .env file on SecretVM.

Can't Find PostgreSQL Server in PgAdmin?

If you've already added the server before, it should be in the left sidebar under "Servers". Just expand it.

If you need to reconnect with a different password:

- Right-click the server â†’ "Properties"
- Go to "Connection" tab
- Update the password
- Click "Save"

âœ… After Password Change

Once you've changed the password and restarted the backend:

Test the API:
https://api.sapphire-finch.vm.scrtlabs.com/health

Should return:
{"status":"healthy","service":"privexbot-backend","version":"0.1.0"}

Test API Docs:
https://api.sapphire-finch.vm.scrtlabs.com/api/docs

Should show Swagger UI.

---

ðŸš¨ If PgAdmin Shows "Server doesn't listen"

This means PostgreSQL container might not be running. In SecretVM portal:

1. Check if privexbot-postgres-secretvm is running
2. If not, restart it
3. Wait 30 seconds for it to fully start
4. Then try connecting from PgAdmin again

---

This is actually a cleaner approach for SecretVM! Let me know once you've changed the password via PgAdmin and restarted the backend. The logs should immediately show success or the exact
error. ðŸŽ‰
