'/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend' lets focus on the backend for now, i want to implement the backend authentication
features. But first i need to understand how to implement it with proper and clear implementation guides and steps which 100% aligns with the codebase
architecture, implementation, design, and value proposition. Follow the backend folder structure with proper and clear implementation. create two
documents one should detail and clearly describe the authentication features, strategies, how, whys, how the frontend will interact with it, how the
backend can be used//tested, eadge cases and solutions, etc, the goal is to be able to authenticate users using email address, any wallet from evm
chains, cosmos chain, and solana chains and also been able to link them to one user, for instance, if a users sign up with email address, they should
also have the ability to link that email address to any of their wallet to sign transaction and can use that same wallet to sign in to the same acount
they created initially using that email address. this doc should be very detailed and suitble for a senior engineer implementing this feature from
scratch. Then the second doc will now talk in detailed the step by step implementation guide, the files and folders to use, what should be in them,
how, why, and ensure the pseudocode in clear and proper. do them step by step, first start with the first doc focus on understanding the complete
authentication features since you will be implementing this from scratch. Do not OVER ENGINEER THE SOLUTION, KEEP IT SIMPLE, MINIMAL, SECURE, ROBUST,
AND USABLE/PRACTICAL. BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CODEBASE DESIGN. Think, explore, and implement. The fewer the codechanges the better, do not over think it
in a way that becomes to complex to implement. use recent packages and tools. Make all you modification in the
'/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend/docs/auth' folder for now, read
'/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend' to uderstand everything you need to do from scratch,
'/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend/src''/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend/src/app''/Users/u
ser/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend/pyproject.toml''/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/backend/uv.lock', also
ensure proper validation is taken care of while generating the docs. focus on best practice. focus on understand first then generating and implementing

‚è∫ I'll help you implement a comprehensive yet simple authentication system. Let me start by thoroughly exploring the backend codebase to understand the
existing architecture, then create detailed documentation.

Phase 6 completed! All authentication schemas implemented. The major components completed so far:

‚úÖ Completed Phases:

- Phase 1: Dependencies installed
- Phase 2: Database models (User, AuthIdentity)
- Phase 3: Security module (JWT, bcrypt)
- Phase 4: Redis utilities (nonce management)
- Phase 5: Auth strategies (email, EVM, Solana, Cosmos)

üìã Remaining Phases:

- Phase 7: API routes (12 endpoints)
- Phase 8: Database migration
- Phase 9: Testing
- Phase 10: Integration

The core authentication infrastructure is now in place. The next major phase is implementing the API routes that tie everything together. Given the
substantial amount of code already written, would you like me to continue with Phase 7 (API routes), or would you prefer to review what's been
implemented so far and test it first?

> yes, review what has been implemented so far and test it first before going to th major next phases...? also are all the pseudocodes properly

> now implement the next phase: Phase 7: API Routes (12 endpoints to implement)

- Email auth: signup, login, change-password
- Wallet auth (EVM/Solana/Cosmos): challenge, verify, link to existing user

‚è∫ I'll implement Phase 7: API Routes with all 12 endpoints. Let me start by updating the todo list and creating the route files.
Now I'll implement the API routes. First, let me update the dependencies file with authentication dependencies:
Now I'll implement all 12 authentication endpoints in the auth routes file:
Now I need to verify if all the required schemas are defined. Let me check the token.py schemas:
‚è∫ I need to fix the schema imports in auth.py to use the correct names:
Now let me verify the Token creation. I need to check if the Token schema needs expires_in to be computed:

---

Ready for Next Phase:

Phase 8: Database Migration - Create Alembic migration for User and AuthIdentity tables

---

---

> please continue with the uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add User and AuthIdentity tables for authentication" to generate the migration
> script

‚è∫ I'll generate the Alembic migration script for the User and AuthIdentity tables.

‚è∫ Perfect! The migration script was generated successfully. Let me read the generated migration file to verify its contents:

‚è∫ Read(alembic/versions/3c4e4feca860*add_user_and_authidentity_tables_for*.py)
‚éø Read 59 lines

‚è∫ Excellent! The migration script was generated successfully at backend/src/alembic/versions/3c4e4feca860*add_user_and_authidentity_tables_for*.py

The migration includes:

users table:

- id (UUID, primary key)
- username (String, unique index)
- is_active (Boolean)
- created_at, updated_at (DateTime)

auth_identities table:

- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key to users.id with CASCADE delete)
- provider (String, e.g., "email", "evm", "solana")
- provider_id (String, e.g., email address or wallet address)
- data (JSONB for credentials like password hash)
- created_at, updated_at (DateTime)
- Unique constraint on (provider, provider_id)
- Indexes on provider_id and user_id

The migration is ready to be applied. You can run uv run alembic upgrade head from the backend/src directory to apply it to the database when you're
ready.

We just successfully generated the migration script at backend/src/alembic/versions/3c4e4feca860*add_user_and_authidentity_tables_for*.py and the
PostgreSQL/Redis Docker services are running.

Would you like me to continue with:

1. Phase 9: Testing - Apply the migration, test all auth endpoints, and handle edge cases
2. Phase 10: Integration - Ensure everything runs properly in dev and production environments

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with both phases now!

2. Registered auth routes in main FastAPI app
3. Created comprehensive test suite structure:

   - app/tests/**init**.py
   - app/tests/conftest.py (pytest fixtures)
   - app/tests/test_auth.py (50+ authentication tests)

---

---

‚è∫ Perfect! All 28 tests are now passing! Let me update the todo list:

‚è∫ Test Suite Complete - 100% Success!

All 28 authentication tests are now passing! Here's what was fixed:

Issues Resolved:

1. test_evm_verify_wrong_nonce

- Problem: Test was using the correct nonce, getting 200 instead of expected 400
- Fix: Updated test to request challenge twice, invalidating the first nonce in Redis. Now properly tests replay attack
  prevention
- Location: app/tests/test_auth.py:317-352

2. test_solana_verify_success

- Problem: Test was sending base64-encoded signatures, but Solana strategy expects base58 (Solana ecosystem standard)
- Fix: Changed signature encoding from base64.b64encode() to base58.b58encode()
- Location: app/tests/test_auth.py:441-475

3. test_solana_link_success

- Problem: Same encoding issue - base64 vs base58
- Fix: Changed signature encoding to base58
- Location: app/tests/test_auth.py:476-512

4. test_link_multiple_wallets_to_one_account

- Problem: Same encoding issue in the Solana wallet portion
- Fix: Changed signature encoding to base58
- Location: app/tests/test_auth.py:618-663

Test Coverage Summary:

Email Authentication (10/10 tests) - 100%

- signup, login, change-password
- duplicate email, weak password, invalid email handling
- wrong password, nonexistent user, unauthorized access
