### Privexbot Knowledge Base

The **Privexbot Knowledge Base** is a powerful feature that helps you manage and use your team’s or company’s information with ease. It supports every step of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process and gives developers a user-friendly way to build smart AI tools and chatbots.

### What It Does

You can upload your company’s documents (like PDFs, Word files, Excel sheets, or even web pages), and Privexbot turns them into organized, searchable data. This information can then be used by **secret ai** to answer questions more accurately — not just relying on what it already knows, but also using your up-to-date documents.

This means if you change your data (for example, update a product guide or company policy), Privexbot can use that new information instantly, so your AI is always working with the latest details.

### How It Works

1. **You upload your content**, such as:

   * Long documents (TXT, DOCX, PDF, Markdown, HTML, JSONL)
   * Structured files (CSV, Excel)
   * Online sources (websites, Notion pages, Google Docs, Google Sheets)

2. **Privexbot automatically processes the data**, breaking it down into smaller chunks and indexing it.

3. When a user asks a question:

   * **Secret ai** scans the Knowledge Base using keywords from the question.
   * The Knowledge Base returns the most relevant content.
   * **Secret ai** uses that information to generate a much more accurate and helpful response.

### Key Benefits

* **Real-Time Updates:** You can update or add information anytime. Secret ai will always work with the most current data.
* **Better Accuracy:** Answers are based on your actual documents, reducing the chance of the AI “hallucinating” or making things up.
* **Fully Customizable:** You choose what goes into your Knowledge Base, so it fits your team’s exact needs.

### Use Case Example

Let’s say you want to build an **AI customer support assistant** using your company’s product manuals and FAQs.

Before, this could take weeks of training and setup.

With Privexbot, you simply upload your support documents to the Knowledge Base, and within minutes, your AI chatbot is ready to go. It will use the content you provided to answer customer questions more accurately — and you can keep improving it by uploading new info anytime.

### Documents and Chunks

In Privexbot:

* A **Knowledge Base** is a collection of **Documents**.
* Each **Document** is automatically divided into smaller **Chunks**.
* Secret ai uses these chunks to find and understand the most relevant information when generating answers.

### External Knowledge Base Support

If your team already has its own Knowledge Base stored somewhere else (outside of Privexbot), you don’t need to move everything.

Privexbot lets you **connect to your external Knowledge Base**. This means your AI assistant can still access and use that data in real time, without needing to re-upload or duplicate content.
