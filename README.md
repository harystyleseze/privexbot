**PrivexBot — Privacy‑First AI Chatbot Builder Powered by Secret VM**

---

## 📌 Overview

PrivexBot is a privacy‑focused, secure chatbot builder platform that empowers organizations to build and deploy AI‑powered chatbots trained on their own data. Unlike many traditional platforms, **all** AI workloads — including data ingestion, training, and inference — are executed within **Secret VM** environments (Trusted Execution Environments, or TEEs) to ensure:

- Confidential computation
- Remote attestation
- Zero data leakage

PrivexBot supports multi‑platform deployment: widgets, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, custom domains or URLs, etc. Teams, enterprises, and agencies can build, manage, and distribute custom AI assistants (powered by **Secret AI**) with full control over knowledge base, workflow logic, and deployment.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Privacy & Security**: Ensure that user data, prompts, and AI model outputs remain confidential and tamper‑proof.
- **Ease of Use**: Provide both simple form‑based chatbot creation and more complex visual/workflow‑oriented “chatflows.”
- **Flexibility & Integrations**: Allow integrations with existing tools (Zapier, telegram, etc.), varied deployment modes (embed widget, APIs, etc.).
- **Scalability**: Should handle multiple bots, users, teams; versioning; memory/context in workflows.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designed with enterprise & data protection regulations in mind (e.g. HIPAA, GDPR).

---

## 🔐 Why Secret VMs and Trusted Infrastructure Matter

Running on Secret VMs introduces several key advantages:

- **End‑to‑end Confidentiality**: Data, prompts, responses are kept encrypted in memory during all compute.
- **Remote Attestation**: Ability to cryptographically verify that the code/data have not been altered.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Reduce risk surface; even administrators or platform hosts cannot access plaintext data.
- **Compliance & Auditing**: Helps satisfy enterprise / regulated‑industry security / privacy requirements.
