hink deep. could you dockerise only the frontend folder to run locally on development environment and on production
environment for secretVM deployment? I have this guide already that was used for a similar project but i want something
similar but perfectly aligned for this particular project een though they seems the same. here is he guide, you are to use
it to learn how to best build the frontend to be dockerised and push to docker hub username harystyles.
'/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/frontend/how-to-dockerise-frontend.md', use this folder for all
script that you will create to make push, helper, build easy and seamless for both dev and prod environments. use semantic
versioning but for this case most of the work are MVP or prelaunch so ensure that this is managed so the main launch
version remains v1.0.0.0 when we want to officially launch. also, create a detailed and clear and complete docker guide
docs. here you will find some hints on secretvm deployment
'/Users/user/Downloads/privexbot/privexbot-mvp/privexbot/frontend/secretVM-hints.md'. properly name your dockerfile,
docker-compose files, etc for each environments to make it easy to use and understand for this project, and be consistent.
focus on making sure the manual processes works fine before working on the github action ci/cd for fast and automated
deployment and build for production when on main or dev branchs. do not over engineer the solution, stick to best practice,
maintain consistency with the codebase, keep it minimal, robust, secure and practical. Think clearly, explore, and
implement.

🎯 Key Features Implemented

1. Dual Environment Setup

- Development: Hot reload, volume mounts, live coding
- Production: Multi-stage, Nginx, ~50-100MB minimal image

2. Runtime Configuration

Same Docker image works across environments:
window.ENV_CONFIG = {
API_BASE_URL: "https://api.privexbot.com/api/v1",
WIDGET_CDN_URL: "https://cdn.privexbot.com",
ENVIRONMENT: "production"
}

3. SecretVM Compatibility

- ❌ No build: directive in production compose
- ✅ Digest pinning: image: harystyles/privexbot-frontend@sha256:...
- ✅ Immutable, verifiable deployments

4. Semantic Versioning for MVP

- 0.x.x → MVP/prelaunch versions
- 0.x.x-rc.N → Release candidates
- 1.0.0 → RESERVED for official launch
- Script warns when using 1.0.0+

5. Automated CI/CD

- Triggers on push to main or dev
- Manual workflow dispatch with custom version
- Outputs digest, deployment instructions, artifacts

6. Security Best Practices

- Multi-stage builds (no dev deps in production)
- Security headers in Nginx
- Health checks
- No secrets in images

✅ Final Solution - Matching Your Working Example

The Issue

Your working example showed the solution all along:

- ✅ Simple Dockerfile: Node build → Nginx, no custom scripts
- ✅ Direct nginx startup: CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
- ✅ No entrypoint complexity

Our mistake: Over-engineered with custom entrypoint script for runtime config.

What Changed

New Dockerfile (Dockerfile.simple):

# Build stage

FROM node:20-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package\*.json .npmrc ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage

FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Exactly like your working example - no custom scripts, just nginx!

Deploy Now

Image: harystyles/privexbot-frontend@sha256:ae948e76c518f6c9e55e75056284cbab835d68f036c637f70554b2a4d1d69fb5

On SecretVM:

# 1. Clean up

cd /mnt/secure/docker_wd
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker rm -f privexbot-frontend-prod 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Upload docker-compose.yml to /mnt/secure/docker_wd/

# 3. Deploy

docker pull harystyles/privexbot-frontend@sha256:ae948e76c518f6c9e55e75056284cbab835d68f036c637f70554b2a4d1d69fb5
docker compose up -d

# 4. CRITICAL: Verify Traefik discovers containers

docker logs docker_wd-traefik-1

Expected in Traefik logs:
✅ Starting provider \*docker.Provider
✅ Creating router app@docker
✅ Creating service app@docker

If missing: Traefik provider failed → Check Docker socket, TLS config, network.

Files Created

1. ✅ Dockerfile.simple - Simplified build matching your example
2. ✅ docker-compose.yml - Ready for SecretVM (/mnt/secure/docker_wd/)
3. ✅ FINAL-FIX.md - Complete deployment guide

Key Takeaway

Simplicity wins. Your working example was the blueprint - no custom entrypoints, just standard nginx. The new image
follows this exact pattern and should work! 🚀
